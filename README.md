# UFO

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Given a dataset, we were tasked with creating a webpage that would allow the user to not only view the data, but also filter the data to show exactly what they are looking for.  

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The process of working this website is relatively simple. When the website first loads, it will look like the following image.

There is a title with a space background at the top, the title of the article on the left and the article on the right side. The article gives a quick explaination on UFOs and the data that is found below. Scrolling down further, you can see the filter on the left side of the screen and the UFO data on the right side. (see image below)

Taking a look at the data, it has been displayed in a table format with a header at the top describing the data in the column. The headers are data, city, state, country, shape (of the UFO), duration, and comments.

The most important part of this webpage is on the left side titled 'Filter Search'. This allows the user to filter the UFO data to help narrow down the information. The user can filter based on Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. They can filter one of these, or they can filter based on multiple selections.

An example of a simple search would be to search by city name. For example, type in 'el cajon' in the city filter text box and hit enter. This will filter the data based on the city El Cajon. Make sure to use lower case letters for all the searches or the filter will not work. 



## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
